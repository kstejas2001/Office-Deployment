The error message "The configuration file wasn't specified. Error Code: 0-2025 (0)" when running the Office Deployment Tool (ODT) indicates that you haven't specified a configuration file, which is necessary for the installation process.


### ‚úÖ 1. Create a Configuration File:
To install Office, you need a configuration.xml file with installation settings.

## üî• Step 1: Create the XML Configuration File

  1. Open Notepad.
  2. Paste the following content for Office 2021 (you can modify it for other versions):
            <Configuration>
              <Add OfficeClientEdition="64" Channel="PerpetualVL2021">
                <Product ID="ProPlus2021Volume">
                  <Language ID="en-us" />
                </Product>
              </Add>
              <Display Level="Full" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />
              <Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" />
            </Configuration>

‚úÖ Explanation:
OfficeClientEdition="64" ‚Üí For 64-bit Office installation. Use 32 for 32-bit.
Channel="PerpetualVL2021" ‚Üí Specifies the Office 2021 volume license version.
Language ID="en-us" ‚Üí Language set to English (US).
  
3. Save the file as:
            configuration.xml
Choose Save as type ‚Üí All Files.
Save it in the same folder as the Office Deployment Tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Install Office with the Configuration File

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Office Deployment Tool and configuration.xml:
            cd C:\Path\To\Office\Deployment\Tool
3. First, download the Office installation files:
            setup.exe /download configuration.xml
4. Once the download is complete, install Office:
            setup.exe /configure configuration.xml

### üí° Tips

If you want to install a specific Office version (Office 2016, 2019, etc.), modify the Product ID and Channel in the XML file accordingly.
Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading the Office files.
